	<h3> We are an organtisation trying to raise awareness about the Impacts of technology. Many of us use technology in our daily lives, not realising how much time we REALLY spend on it. The use of technology has increased immensely over the past decade and it affects the way of people's learning and their way of life too. We cover the different types of effects technology can cause and the different types of uses it has. Of course, technology has its down-side... but what about the advantages? </h3>
	<h3> Here is a quick interesting video on technology's development throughout the years</h3>
