	<h3><u> What is Artificial Intelligence? </h3> </u>
	<p> <i> <b> Definition --> </b>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.</i> </p>
	<h3> <u> What are the advantages of Artificial Intelligence </h3> </u>
	<p> <b> Reduction in human error : </b> The phrase “human error” was born because humans make mistakes from time to time. Computers, however, do not make these mistakes if they are programmed properly. With Artificial intelligence, the decisions are taken from the previously gathered information applying a certain set of algorithms. So errors are reduced and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility. For example, In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error. </p>
	<p> <b> Available 24/7 :</b> An Average human will work for 4–6 hours a day excluding the breaks. Humans are built in such a way to get some time out for refreshing themselves and get ready for a new day of work and they even have weekly offed to stay intact with their work-life and personal life. But using AI we can make machines work 24x7 without any breaks and they don’t even get bored, unlike humans. For example, Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many queries and issues which can be handled effectively using AI.</P>
	<p> <b> Faster decisions : </b> Using AI alongside other technologies we can make machines take decisions faster than a human and carry out actions quicker. While taking a decision human will analyze many factors both emotionally and practically but AI-powered machine works on what it is programmed and delivers the results in a faster way. </p>
	<h3> <u> How about the disadvantages? </u> </h3>
	<p> <b> High costs of creation : </b> As AI is updating every day the hardware and software need to get updated with time to meet the latest requirements. Machines need repairing and maintenance which need plenty of costs. It’ s creation requires huge costs as they are very complex machines.</p>
	<p> <b> Making humans lazy :</b> AI is making humans lazy with its applications automating the majority of the work. Humans tend to get addicted to these inventions which can cause a problem to future generations. </p>
