	<h3> <u> 	What is 'Automated Decision Making' ? </h3> </u>
	<p> Automated decision-making is the process of making a decision by automated means without any human involvement. These decisions can be based on factual data, as well as on digitally created profiles or inferred data. Examples of this include:
	<ul>
		<li> An online decision to award a loan </li>
		<li> an aptitude test used for recruitment which uses pre-programmed algorithms and criteria. </li>
	</ul>
	<h3> <u> What are the benefits of automated decision making? </h3> </u>
	<p> Automated decision making can be very useful for organisations and also benefit individuals in many sectors, including healthcare, education, financial services and marketing. They can lead to quicker and more consistent decisions, particularly in cases where a very large volume of data needs to be analysed and decisions made very quickly. </p>
	<p> <b> Fast, error-free decisions : </b> The primary advantage is the ability to make quick decisions that are error-free. It also ensures consistency, by offloading human decision-making to an automated process. This allows for the artificial intelligence to self-correct and take remedial measures without the constant need of supervision. This automation is constantly applied to every business decision, 24/7, leaving no room for inconsistency or error. </p>
	<p> <b> Better utilisation of staff : </b> By reducing dependency on human intervention for repetitive tasks, employees can concentrate on jobs that will improve revenue generation and open up new opportunities. </p>	
	<p> <b> An Increase in compliance : </b> By bringing down the occurrences of regulatory or contractual errors, organizations can save themselves from fines for non-compliance. Decision automation does not eliminate all chances of error, but it does reduce the chance significantly. </p>
	<h3> <u>What are the risks associated with Automated Decision Making? </u> </h3>
	<p> <b> System design failure : 	</b>  Decision support systems are designed to the specific needs of a decision maker. If you don’t know what you want a DSS to do or how it should help you, it will be difficult to design a system that fits your needs. And when you use a vague DSS, the results generated are not what you’re looking for. Such situations may arise because of system design failure.</p>
	<p> <b> Difficulty in quantifying all of the data :  </b>  A decision support system majorly relies on quantifiable data. Consequently, it’s difficult to analyze intangible or indefinable data. In reality, some values cannot be very specific and defined in numbers. Even though a DSS may quantify some of these aspects, the end result must be duly considered by the decision makers. They must use their own judgment when making the final decision.</p>
	<p> <b> Information Overload :  </b>  A computerized decision making system may sometimes result in information overload. Since it analyzes all aspects of a problem, it leaves a user in a dilemma what to consider and what not to consider. Not each bite of information is necessary in decision making. But when it’s present, a decision maker finds it difficult to ignore information that is not a priority.</p>
