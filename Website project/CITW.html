	<div class="column">
	<p> Generally associated with increases in workplace productivity, computers allow each employee, using quick technologies such as email and Internet fact-checking, to accomplish more with every hour of work. While increases in productivity allow some employers to scale back on hiring, the reality is that more productive workers are a better labor investment, and employers interested in growing their businesses are actually more likely to hire new people and expand. As an industry in itself, computer technology also creates jobs in new fields like programming, computer-aided design and animation, Internet marketing and online publishing. </u>

	<h3> <u> What are the advantages? </u> </h3>
	<h4> Educations and training </h4>
	<p>Education used to be limited to those who could physically and financially get to a school or college. Today, online education enables information to be passed down easily - and in many cases, for free. Distance learning allows a person who is working during the day to go to school at night or at another time that is convenient for them. This makes for a better-educated workforce with many opportunities for people who may not otherwise be able to go to school.Online education modules make onboarding much easier, eliminating the need for an in-person orientation. In-service training can be done on breaks and remotely. Computerized testing has made it much easier - and more accurate - to assess and maintain worker skills and certifications. All of these forms of time-saving and new possibilities have been brought about by taking advantage of computer application technology.</p>
	<h4>  Information Security </h4>
	<p>The benefits of computers make it much easier to keep private information secure through the use of password-protected servers and virus elimination software. While even today's high-tech security solutions aren't always foolproof against society's best hackers, most information on computers is much safer than in the days of file cabinets, when the right pair of eyes with the right set of keys could go snooping.</p>
	<h3> <u> What about disadvantages? </u> </h3>
	<h4>Dangers of Hacking</h4>
	<p>A problem with workplace computer systems is that many small businesses store sensitive customer information, such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, bank account information and addresses. If a hacker successfully breaks into a business's computer system, he can use the information to drain bank accounts or run up charges on credit cards. </p>
	<h4>Invasion of Privacy</h4>
	<p>Many companies institute a policy of monitoring employee computer use to prevent against inappropriate or even unlawful activity. In some cases, employees are required to sign a release acknowledging their understating of the company's monitoring policy.Employees may view this as an invasion of their privacy and point to it as an example of being watched by "Big Brother." It can also create an ethical dilemma, pitting the employee's right to privacy against the employer's right to protect herself. </p>
